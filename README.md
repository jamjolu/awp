Accessible Web Pages with Text-to-Speech

This project consists of a set of web pages along with associated css, and js resources that offer simple layouts, easy tab/enter navigation, and text-to-speech output. In addition, the pages have a crude editor built in offering users with limited technical skills means to construct customized pages. Together the page set was intended to offer simple alternative communication means, or for presenting accessible curricula. The page set was envisioned as a way to provide students at our school with materials that were very local, compelling for them, and not necessarily materials covered by more full featured subscription services like Unique Learning and News2You. 

The web pages in the collection can be used to construct a static website. All that is needed is a web browser, an edtitor like Geany, and a place to host the pages like Neocities, or even your hard drive. The simplest method for saving a page like the gridBuilder is to use "Save as webpage complete" which would store the page and resources on your computer. The simple 2 and 4 button communications pages use local storage to store up to 12 setups. These might come in handy when a user's communication device is unavailable but the Internet and a browser are still accessible. Check out the sample pages at this website I use for development: [link to jamjolu.neocities.org](https://jamjolu.neocities.org/)
