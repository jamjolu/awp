Accessible Web Pages with Text-to-Speech

This project consists of a set of web pages along with associated css, and js resources that offer simple low clutter layouts, easy tab/enter navigation, and text-to-speech output. In addition, the pages have a crude editor built in offering users with limited technical skills means to construct customized pages. Together the page set was intended to offer simple alternative communication means, or for presenting accessible curricula. I envisioned the set as a quick way to provide students at our school with easy-access materials that were very local, compelling for them, and not covered by more full featured subscription services like Unique Learning and News2You. 

The web page tempates in the collection can be used to construct a static website. All that is needed is a web browser, an editor like Geany, and a place to host the pages like Neocities, or even your hard drive. The simplest method for saving a page like the gridBuilder is to use "Save as webpage complete" which would store the page and resources on your computer. The gridBuilder pages can be printed and used as an offline picture based communication strategy. Also included in the set are simple 2 and 4 button communications pages that use local storage to store up to 12 setups. These might come in handy when a user's communication device is unavailable but the Internet and a browser are.

The templates work best in up-to-date browsers that support text-to-speech, flexbox and grid css layout standards, and on most platforms. The Google Chrome browser offers the best support for text-to-speech across platforms. Text-to-speech does have some issues, and I haven't explored languages other than English. In some cases the text-to-speech in English sounds funny because it is being generated by a speech engine in another lanuage in spite of my attempts to filter out non-English speech engines. Another concession I had to make was to break long sections of text into puntuation teminated sentences and phrases to mostly avoid the length limits set by the Google speech engines. This causes the speech to pause in places where a human reader would not, as in Mr.(pause) Magoo. Also, tts speech engines don't always get it right when there are more than one way to pronounce a word like "read." And, abbreviations can cause the tts engine confusion as in St. Nicholas versus Elm St., or Dr. Strange versus Elm Dr.. So, it is better to avoid abbreviations.

In browsers other than Chrome, like Firefox, Edge or Opera, the text-to-speech will probably depend on a platform local tts services. On a Linux device this can be pretty awful sounding. Setting a Linux machine up to have a good sounding tts voice is also a challenge. Again, Google Chrome is likely the best choice for Linux users.
